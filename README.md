###GitHub Repository for the publication: "The GRIMMER test: A method for testing the validity of reported measures of variability"

The script "get_variances.py" will enumerate all possible variances and means for a given sample size.

The resulting files are saved in the folder "raw_variances".

Note, at a sample size of 99 the script can take 24 hours to complete.

To extract the patterns from the variances, run "get_patterns.py"

This runs fast, and these results are present in "patterns"

Stand alone GRIMMER functions and tests are present in the scripts "GRIMMER_SD.py", "GRIMMER_SE.py", "GRIMMER_VAR.py"

Scripts for the figures are also provided.
